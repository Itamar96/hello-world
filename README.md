# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Itamar B. Castillo. I’m someone who really enjoys spending time outdoors, whether it’s hiking through the woods or just being surrounded by nature. I have a deep appreciation for animals and the calm they bring. I'm also passionate about self-care and health, always looking for ways to grow, stay balanced, and live intentionally. I believe in making space for both personal well-being and meaningful connections with others.
